Task 3: Iris Flower Classification
Objective
The aim of this task is to develop a machine learning model that classifies Iris flowers into their respective species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements.

Dataset
The Iris dataset includes measurements for 150 Iris flowers, divided into three species. Each entry contains four features:

Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
The Iris dataset is available in the Scikit-learn library.
