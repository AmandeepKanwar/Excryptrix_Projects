# Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview

This project comprises three distinct machine learning tasks:

1. **Titanic Survival Prediction**: A classification task to predict passenger survival on the Titanic.
2. **Movie Rating Prediction**: A regression task to estimate movie ratings based on various features.
3. **Iris Flower Classification**: A classification task to identify Iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements.

## Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

### Objective

The goal of this task is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project using a well-known dataset.

### Dataset

The dataset typically used for this task contains information about individual passengers, including:

- **Passenger ID**
- **Survived** (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass** (Ticket class)
- **Name**
- **Sex**
- **Age**
- **SibSp** (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- **Parch** (Number of parents/children aboard)
- **Ticket**
- **Fare**
- **Cabin**
- **Embarked** (Port of Embarkation)

You can download the dataset from the following link: [Titanic Dataset](https://example.com)

### Steps

1. **Data Collection and Exploration**
   - Load the dataset.
   - Explore the dataset to understand its structure and identify important features.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values, particularly for age, cabin, and embarked.
   - Encode categorical features like sex and embarked.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create new features or modify existing ones to improve model performance.

4. **Model Selection**
   - Choose classification models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machines (SVM).

5. **Model Training**
   - Split the data into training and test sets.
   - Train the models using the training data.

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Optimize model hyperparameters to enhance prediction accuracy.

8. **Conclusion**
   - Analyze results and identify key factors influencing passenger survival.

## Task 3: Iris Flower Classification

### Objective

The aim of this task is to develop a machine learning model that classifies Iris flowers into their respective species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements.

### Dataset

The Iris dataset includes measurements for 150 Iris flowers, divided into three species. Each entry contains four features:

- **Sepal Length**
- **Sepal Width**
- **Petal Length**
- **Petal Width**

The Iris dataset is available in the Scikit-learn library.

### Steps

1. **Data Collection and Exploration**
   - Load the Iris dataset from Scikit-learn.
   - Analyze the dataset to understand feature distributions and relationships.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Standardize or normalize the features if necessary.

3. **Model Selection**
   - Choose classification models, such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, or Support Vector Machines (SVM).

4. **Model Training**
   - Split the data into training and test sets.
   - Train the models using the training data.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Optimize model hyperparameters to improve classification performance.

7. **Conclusion**
